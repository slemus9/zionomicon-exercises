    Some other examples:

      - ZIO[R, E, A] is contravariant with respect to R (Resource), because it needs it to produce Either[E, A]
      - ZSink is contravariant with respecto to I (Input), because it needs it to produce some output

    have been seen unralated, and we wouldn't be able to compose them
